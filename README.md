# UX/UI Research Project

The design of a website is incredibly important for many reasons. Without an engaging, fluid design, users are bound to leave a site earlier than we, as developers, intend. No matter how well a website functions, without a great design that draws users in and keeps them engaged, it's destined to fail.

## Summary

UX refers to the user's experience and UI refers to the user interface of a website. Both of these need to be cohesive and attractive to a user in order for the user to want to use and interact with the site.

## UX/UI Design Components

### Keep it simple
The flow of the website should be simple and easy to follow so that the user does not get frustrated and is able to use the site easily. When designing the ux/ui for my sites in the future I think that keeping the user story simple but functional is the way to go. I have been using my research to help steer the direction that my personal portfolio is headed in. I've been taking out fluff and other things that could cause potential employers to dislike my style. For that reason, I've chosen to keep it to a simple, one page application that doesn't require scrolling. Everything the user needs is right in front of them and is available at the click of a button. This definitely is applicable in building other, more complicated sites as well. Having a well-thought out path and story that directly functions in the way it's supposed to will help the user stay happy and engaged with the site. 

### Wire Frames and Planning Ahead
Starting with the end in mind is a concept that I've been practicing for a decade in the field of education. I'm excited to take this idea into my web development career as well. The big way to plan with the end in mind is by using wire frames and other online tools to help shape the website before the coding even begins. This can be done with a notebook and pen, or more thorough tools online. One online application to help with these plans is Lucid Chart. They offer services for free and users can use their application to plan out their wire frames with great detail, accuracy, and scaling. Using a wire framing service like Lucid at the beginning of the planning phase is completely necessary. Instead of haphazardly adding things to an application and struggling with moving them to the proper places later, planning and placing them with intention will avoid lots of problems in advance.

### Presentation and Colors
One issue that I want to stay ahead of is the visible presentation of the websites and applications I am building. The color choices are particularly important, so I have been looking into some color palette applications to help with attractive choices that draw users in. I like the brighter colors, so I need to keep the rest of the application presentation simple to balance out the chaos. Color Hunt is a free application that offers lots of color palettes to designers and developers that I'll be using in the future.

### Mobile First Design
Designing a mobile-first application is the direction to take. Most users will be accessing applications from their phones, so having sites that are easily accessible from a mobile stand-point is critical. I've done a lot of research on grids and how to make those responsive as an application scales. I hope to further implement that in my designs in the future. The grid design itself makes the site look clean and accessible, so I plan to continue on that path. One consideration is the time that a mobile user has to access the content. As a developer, I need to figure out what a mobile user needs and wants to access versus a tablet user or a desktop user. As the screens increase in size, so does a user's time to explore a site, hypothetically. This can help developers to prioritize content based on screen size, starting small and adding more content as the screen gets bigger.
