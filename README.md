# UX/UI Research Project

The design of a website is incredibly important for many reasons. Without an engaging, fluid design, users are bound to leave a site earlier than we, as developers, intend. No matter how well a website functions, without a great design that draws users in and keeps them engaged, it's destined to fail.

## Summary

UX refers to the user's experience and UI refers to the user interface of a website. Both of these need to be cohesive and attractive to a user in order for the user to want to use and interact with the site.
